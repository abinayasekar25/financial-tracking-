            <h2>1. Pay Full Amount, Not Just Minimum Due</h2>
            <p><strong>Why It's Important:</strong> Paying only the minimum due results in the unpaid balance being carried forward with high-interest rates, typically around <span class="highlight">36% annually</span> (3% monthly). This can lead to significant debt accumulation over time.</p>
            <p><strong>Action:</strong> Always pay the full outstanding amount before the due date to avoid interest and late fees.</p>
            <div class="math">
                <strong>Mathematical Representation:</strong><br>
                Interest = Principal Amount × (Annual Interest Rate / 12) × Number of Months<br>
                Example: If unpaid balance = $1,000 and interest rate = 36% annually,<br>
                Monthly Interest = 1000 × (36 / 100) / 12 = $30
            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. High Interest on Revolving Credit</h2>
            <p>If you can't pay the full bill, convert the outstanding balance into a personal loan. Personal loans generally have lower interest rates (10&ndash;18%) compared to credit card debt (30&ndash;36%).</p>
            <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> This reduces the cost of borrowing and provides structured EMIs to clear the debt.</p>
            <div class="math">
                <strong>Mathematical Comparison:</strong><br>
                Credit Card Interest = Principal × 36% annually<br>
                Personal Loan Interest = Principal × 18% annually<br>
                Example Savings: For $1,000 debt, interest savings = (36% - 18%) × $1,000 = $180 annually
            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Maintain a Good Credit Score</h2>
            <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> A strong credit score (750+) ensures easier approval for future loans, better interest rates, and higher credit limits.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pay bills on time, including credit cards and EMIs.</li>
                <li>Avoid utilizing more than 30% of your credit limit to maintain a low credit utilization ratio.</li>
                <li>Check your credit report regularly for errors.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="math">
                <strong>Credit Utilization Calculation:</strong><br>
                Credit Utilization (%) = (Total Credit Used / Total Credit Limit) × 100<br>
                Example: If Total Credit Used = $3,000 and Total Credit Limit = $10,000,<br>
                Credit Utilization = (3000 / 10000) × 100 = 30%
            </div>

        <section>
            <h2>4. Use a Credit Card Against an FD</h2>
            <p><strong>For Beginners or Those Rebuilding Credit:</strong> Secure a credit card against a fixed deposit (FD) to ensure that you don’t miss payments. The FD acts as collateral, lowering the risk for the bank and ensuring responsible usage.</p>
            <div class="math">
                <strong>FD-backed Credit Limit:</strong><br>
                Credit Limit = 75% &ndash; 90% of FD Value<br>
                Example: If FD = $5,000, Credit Limit = 0.75 × $5,000 = $3,750 (minimum)
            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5. Avoid Common Traps</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Late Payments:</strong> Missing due dates not only incurs late fees but also negatively affects your credit score.</li>
                <li><strong>Cash Withdrawals on Credit Cards:</strong> These attract high-interest rates immediately, with no interest-free period. Avoid unless in extreme emergencies.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="math">
                <strong>Cost of Cash Withdrawal:</strong><br>
                Withdrawal Fee = 2.5% &ndash; 3% of Amount Withdrawn<br>
                Immediate Interest = Principal × Daily Interest Rate × Days Outstanding<br>
                Example: For $1,000 withdrawn at 36% annually for 30 days,<br>
                Daily Interest Rate = 36 / 365 = 0.0986%<br>
                Interest = 1000 × 0.000986 × 30 = $29.58
            </div>

        <section>
            <h2>6. Benefits of Responsible Credit Card Usage</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rewards and Cashback:</strong> Use cards for routine expenses to earn rewards, but always pay the bill in full.</li>
                <li><strong>Improving Financial Discipline:</strong> Set alerts for due dates and limit spending to what you can repay comfortably.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>7. Plan Monthly Checks</h2>
            <p>Use free reports from different sources in each month to avoid redundancy and ensure coverage:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Month 1:</strong> Check using CIBIL and one major bank’s app.</li>
                <li><strong>Month 2:</strong> Use Experian or CRIF High Mark alongside another bank.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Limit Hard Inquiries:</strong> Too many inquiries (e.g., loan or card applications) can lower your credit score. When checking your credit score for informational purposes, ensure the bank or service initiates a soft inquiry, which does not impact your score.</p>
        </section>

            <h2>8. Consolidate Your Credit History</h2>
            <p>If discrepancies are found, file for corrections with the credit bureaus or the respective bank.</p>
